Images Classification by TensorFlow JavaScript Using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) 

Image Classification uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the presence of items in a picture and to categorize the picture
In this repository, Used a teachable machine website to insert the datasets which are pictures of fruits, and train a computer to recognize  images of fruits and classify  them into their categories which are Banana, Apple, Kiwi, pineapple, Mango
